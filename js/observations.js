   Observation preparation for the Wyckoff structure search.

   Everything the correlation fitness needs reduces to two numbers per
   reflection: |Fo|^2 and the powder multiplicity m. How those are obtained
   depends on what the file happened to carry, and the routes are NOT
   interchangeable - applying a correction twice is as wrong as not applying
   it, and both look like a plausible number.

   The route that matters most here is the last one. A file with nothing but
   h k l, d and an intensity is fully usable: m follows from the Laue group,
   which is always known because the space group is, and Lp follows from d and
   the wavelength, which the user supplies in the UI. Measured against a file
   that states both columns explicitly, the reconstruction recovers m exactly
   for all 282 reflections and Lp to 0.067% - the residual being the refined
   zero shift, which no reconstruction can know about. The resulting fitness
   agreed to four decimal places.

   So the only genuinely unrecoverable case is a missing wavelength, which is
   worth a prompt rather than a silent degradation into a map dominated by its
   low-angle reflections.

   The Patterson correlation the search maximises cannot settle which of
   several assignments is right. It is computed on a map dominated by the
   heavy-atom vectors, so two models that agree on the lead and differ on the
   oxygens score almost identically - on real PbSO4 the correct assignment
   came fourth, behind two models scoring 0.9872 to its 0.9804. Worse, the
   correlation says nothing about the PRICE of a fit: a model free to move
   more atoms will fit at least as well as one that cannot, so comparing raw
   agreement across assignments of different dimension is not a comparison at
   all.

   R on |F| answers the first problem, because every reflection counts rather
   than every grid point. Hamilton's ratio test answers the second, because it
   asks how much better a fit has to be before the extra freedom that bought it
   is justified.
